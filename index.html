            <ol>
              <li>Along with HTML an CSS, JavaScript is one of the three main things of the www (World Wide Web). It enables interactive web pages and thus is an essential part of web applications. A majority of websites use it and all major web browsers have a devoted JavaScript engine to execute it.</li>
              <li>JavaScript is single threaded. This is the reason lots of people who use multi-threaded programming thinks its working is slow as it would not be able to make use of all the cores of the CPU properly.</li>
              <li>Despite the fact that there are similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, respective standard libraries and syntax, these two languages are distinct and differ significantly in design.</li>
              <li>Like all other scripting languages, arrays and objects can be created with a brief shortcut syntax. These literals structure the basis of JSON data format.</li>
              <li>JavaScript supports regular expressions in a manner similar to Perl, which provides a concise and powerful syntax for text manipulation that is more sophisticated than the built-in string functions.</li>
            </ol>
            <h6><strong>Full Stack JavaScript Job Market:</strong> The average salary for a Javascript Developer is <span style="color:blue">$112,424</span> per year in the United States.

            <h6>More info & fun fact:</h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Python for Data Science Course is the most preferred programming language when it comes to data science by the majority of the professionals in this field. Though there are other programming languages such as R, SAS, etc. Python stands out from the rest because of its unique features.</li>
              <li>Python code looks more like a conversation between a human and machine in English language rather than the complex syntax followed by many programming languages such as Java, C++, C#, etc. In short, the language is highly intuitive and easy to follow because of the English language natured keywords.</li>
              <li>The code base of a software typed in Python programming language is highly optimized for maintenance and debugging with fewer lines of code needed to perform a particular operation which usually takes several lines in other programming languages.</li>
              <li>Python is not a standalone programming language and is supported by global communities who keep on developing python libraries and support functions. Furthermore, Python for Data Science is an open source programming language which simply means that anyone across the globe can contribute to the community and make Python more useful and convenient to use.</li>
            </ul>
            <h6><strong> Websites Built with Python :</strong> Google, Facebook, YouTube, Pinterest, Dropbox, Spotify, Netflix, Quora.

            <h3>Ruby</h3>
            <h6>More info & fun fact:<br>
                Ruby is a dynamic, reflective, object-oriented, general-purpose programming language. Rails is a popular framework used by Ruby developers
            </h6>
            <ul>
              <li>Ruby and Rails are both well known for being beginner friendly</li>
              <li>As Laurence Bradford told us, “the main selling point of Rails is the philosophy called convention over configuration (CoC) – meaning it is a framework that has a structured layout with defaults (read: it’s easy to get up and running - sort of like a web app starter kit)”</li>
              <li>Ruby syntax is ideal for those who prefer pattern-matching characters because it uses differing characters as analogues to keywords</li>
              <li>There’s a strong support community both online and offline</li>
            </ul>
            <h6><strong>Companies that use Ruby:</strong> Hulu, Twitter, ZenDesk, Basecamp, Shopify, Urban Dictionary, GitHub, Kickstarter.
